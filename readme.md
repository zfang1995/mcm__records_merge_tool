## Project Overview

This project is a tool for merging MCM_records that generated by MCM Recorder. It accepts an input directory path and an output directory path as command line arguments, then merges all MCM record files from the input directory into one output file.

## Usage Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the command line.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
node MCM_records_merge_tool.js <input_directory_path> <output_directory_path>
```

Here, `<input_directory_path>` is the path to the input directory,
and `<output_directory_path>` is the path to the output directory.
If `<output_directory_path>` is omitted, the output directory defaults to the input directory.

## Notes

- Ensure the input directory contains only MCM record files. Other types of files will be ignored.
